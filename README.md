# Data Mining University Project

Discovering relations in GrandEst Dataset using [Paspeilleur (for Non-binary data) or Caspailleur (For Binary Data)].  

The Task is to Explore, Clean, Analyse, and conclude using the visualisations' tools and the Data Mining code (mentioned down below) to extract implications and hidden patterns in the Dataset that contains more than 1 million rows and 95+ Columns.

(This is only one part of four parts of the project. They all follow the same methology, but each part focuses on different hypotheses extracted from analysing the Dataset.
